## Project Description
```
This is the repository for CS461 Machine Learning Principles Fall 2021 w/ professor Karl Stratos
```
## Homework 1
Overview: apply polynomial regression method to Boston Housing dataset to predict mdeian home prices in various areas of the Boston suburbs from a variety of features
```

1. Completed gradient descent function in polynomial regression and fit different polynomial models(degree 1, 2, and other) to the training set and record the validation error rate
2. Fit polymial models again to the dataset with asymmetric loss function (where we favor underestimation) and record the validation error rate
3. Compared the model trained with symmetric function and the one trained with asymmetric function
```

## Homework 3 Twitter Sentiment Analysis
Overview: Applied SVM to analyze the sentiments of tweets regarding US airline service quality. 
```

1.Implemented a linear SVM classifier and kernelized SVM classifier (with kernelized Pegasos algorithm) to fit linear data and nonlinear data separately
2.Trained the linear SVM classifier and Kernel SVM classifier with tweets training dataset, tuned on the validation dataset, and found the model with the highest accuracy to 85%
```

## Homework 4 Spam Detection
Overview: Applied decision tree and boosting method to determine whether an email is spam or not
```
1.Completed decision tree with Gini impurity using fit stump algorithm
2.Fit the model with highest accuracy on the spam dataset trying various hyperparameter settings
3.Applied adaboost algorithm to a shallow decision to boost its performance and find the best model with the spam dataset
```
## Homework 5 Image classification
Overview: Applied GMM(Gauassian Mixture Models) in a generative classifier with expectation maximization algorithm to classify images into ten Fashion MNIST classes
```
1.Computed gaussian log probability, mean initialization, parameter update, and accuracy calculation functions for diagonal and non-diagonal matrices
2.Fit a single GMM and a mixture of 3 GMMs for each class and find the hyperparameters with highest validation accuracy
3.Plotted the trend of the training accuracy and validation accuracy for these GMMs with different hyperparameters
